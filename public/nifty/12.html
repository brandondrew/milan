<h2>Notebooks are small town's cave writings</h2>
<div class="date">August <span>20</span> 2008</div>
<p>In a startling discovery last week, I uncovered cave writings in my office.</p>

<p>I came across them stuffed in a bottom desk drawer and stacked on a shelf in a dusty cabinet.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I found they were written in a familiar hand and required little deciphering to interpret.</p>

<p>They were spiral-bound reporter notebooks. Hundreds of them. A total of 311, to be exact. Each page filled with scribbled quotes, observations, explanations, figures and facts.</p>

<p>As I flipped through the notebooks, each pen or pencil scratch triggered a tale of life in a small town.</p>

<p>Here was a heated City Council meeting where budget cuts were approved; a teacher's retirement; a high school football game; local election results; the heartbreaking death of a teen; a controversy over a development; a young boy living with autism; an old woman singing in a band.</p>

<p>One story followed another. Page after page after page. Six years' worth of goings-on.</p>

<p>Over the past half-dozen years, as a staff writer for The Saline Reporter and The Milan News-Leader, I have dulled my share of pencils chronicling the two communities.</p>

<p>Perusing the notebooks, I was struck by the realization that for the past six years I have worked under a misimpression.</p>

<h2>More sugar scandal mysteries unravel</h2>
<div class="date">August <span>19</span> 2008</div>
<p>Olive Friend spent a good part of her life working hard to steal money in New York. She and her mother, and their husbands, started in about 1883 convincing some investors to start a company called the Electric Sugar Refining Co., so they could sell stock and give the money to Olive and her family.</p>

<p>Olive's husband, Henry C. Friend, claimed to be a professor and a chemist. Her mother's husband, William E. Howard, claimed to operate a sugar refinery after the death of Professor Friend in New York.</p>

<p>The whole scandal, which spread across New York and Liverpool, England, lasted until the end of December in 1888. By that time, the players were back home in Milan, enjoying their ill-gotten fortunes.</p>

<p>Both Olive and her mother were quick to invest their "sugar money" riches in real estate. Olive bought several pieces of land along County Road from her aunt, Mary, and uncle, Henry Hack.</p>

<p>Her mother, Emily Howard, must have loved the home on County Street, because she built a very close copy of her daughter's house at the corner of Arkona and Platt Road.
